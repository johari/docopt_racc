What?
=====

This is an alternative implementation for `docopt.rb`,
an option parser written in ruby.

For more information on docopt, visit [its website](http://docopt.org).
To obtain `docopt.rb`, see
[docopt.rb on github](https://github.com/docopt/docopt.rb).

You are encouraged to use the the original `docopt.rb` for your ruby CLIs,
as for the time being, this repo exists for development purposes only.

Contributing
============
If you're planning something big, open an issue on this repo
to discuss the matters.

Also, if you have some general ideas on docopt, you are very welcomed
to discuss it with the docopt community on
[docopt's issues page](https://github.com/docopt/docopt/issues/)!

For the purposes of this repo:

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
